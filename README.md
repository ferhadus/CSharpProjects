# C# Projects
Under this repository, there are projects I made with C #.

```bash
# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/ferhatiltas/CSharpProjects

# Access
$ cd CSharpProjects

# Pull dependencies
$ flutter pub get

# Run the project (emulator or physical device needs to be connected first)
$ flutter run

# Build an apk
$ flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```
